AbstractDirect imaging surveys have found that long-period super-Jupiters are rare. By contrast, recent modeling of the widespread gaps in protoplanetary disks revealed by ALMA suggests an abundant population of smaller Neptune to Jupiter-mass planets at large separations. The thermal emission from such lower-mass planets is negligible at optical and near-infrared wavelengths, leaving only their weak signals in reflected light. Planets do not scatter enough light at these large orbital distances, but there is a natural way to enhance their reflecting area.</description>
