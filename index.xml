AbstractWe present a novel meso-scale model for computing anisotropic and asymmetric friction for contacts in rigid body simulations that is based on surface facet orientations. The main idea behind our approach is to compute a direction dependent friction coefficient that is determined by an objectâ€™s roughness. Specifically, where the friction is dependent on asperity interlocking, but at a scale where surface roughness is also a visual characteristic of the surface.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a computer science master student at McGill University studying under the supervision of Paul G. Kry and Sheldon Andrews. Before that, I completed my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in applied mathematics from the University of Toronto.
My research interests lie in the application of physics theory within computer animation. Currently I focus on modeling friction for rigid body systems. Friction is a complex phenomenon, and we try to develop models that allow for real-time interactions while still preserving physical accuracy.</description>

      <title>Direct Imaging of Irregular Satellite Disks in Scattered Light</title>

AbstractDirect imaging surveys have found that long-period super-Jupiters are rare. By contrast, recent modeling of the widespread gaps in protoplanetary disks revealed by ALMA suggests an abundant population of smaller Neptune to Jupiter-mass planets at large separations. The thermal emission from such lower-mass planets is negligible at optical and near-infrared wavelengths, leaving only their weak signals in reflected light. Planets do not scatter enough light at these large orbital distances, but there is a natural way to enhance their reflecting area.</description>
